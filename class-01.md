## How the web works

### Clients and servers

Computers connection to the web are called clients and servers.</br>

Clients are usually used by users. Server's store/host webpages, sites, or apps. 

#### TCP/IP:
The communication protocols we use in order to interact with internet-based content.

#### DNS
This pairs the FQDN with the IP so that you can reach content based off host rather than IP. Think of this like an address book where 'mark' is the same as www.amazon.com and '123 Main Street' is his IP.

## Poem on HTTP

Look, connect, send, wait,
Am I picking you up for a date...
No...load...close...

First we look.
Look where? The ISP. AT&T. Fiber in this bish.
DNS! Don't distress. That hostname is what you need.

Connect? connect...SYN-ACK attack that pack-et we-get.

We send re-quest and wait a bit until we load our insta. 


## Anatomy of a HTML element

HTML elements contain opening tags closing tags and content

> <tagname>content...</tagname>

both article and section tags are semantic tags

> Article tags contain independent content

> section tags split the page into sections



### How does metadata influence search engine optimization:

Primarily metadata helps SEO efforts because the metadata is written in the search engines language and it helps the search engine to better understand the websites content. 

### The <meta> Tag:

The meta tag defines metadata about and html document. Metadata is data about data. 

### String Vs Number

The differences between a string and a number are the designators '' between which the string is contained

> blah = 43
> blah = '43'

The second one is a string.

### Variables

Variables are how you assign an object with a value

### HTML Attributes

The HTML attribute provides additional information about HTML elements. Such as href and src

### First step to Design a Website

Create a goal

### Most important question to answer

What exactly do I want to accomplish?

### Semantics

you should use <h1> over <span> because while span will look like a heading it will not have any semantic value

### Javascript

Two things that require JavaScript are capture windows and ads.

You add javascript to a website by referencing a js script file into your html document, similar to the way you embed a .css file.
