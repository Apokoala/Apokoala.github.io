>Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
A syntax error occurs due to fault in the program syntax and a logical error occurs due to a fault in the algorithm.

>List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
I have had so many errors I really couldnt recall just one but the console log gives you the row and position that the error occured and Ive used that to reference where in my code the error occured



>How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Of course being able to find bugs in your program more efficiently and be able to interpret the bug "reporting" to that end will be very important.


>How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
It allows you to interact with your code in a more visually referenced way that will give you better understanding of your code in general and help you, of course, figure out where things went wrong.


>Define what a breakpoint is.
its a place where you want to pause the execution in order to identify the problem that prevented your code from running



>What is the call stack?
it is a mechanism for the interpreter to keep track of its place in a script.

### What went wrong

Well...I was born at a young age...downhill from there.

> types of errors:

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
