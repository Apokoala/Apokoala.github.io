## Class reading 04: HTMLLinks, CSS Layout, JS Functions

### HTML

<!-- many of the examples here were sourced from reading @ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks -->

>1.) When creating a basic link you wrap it inside a hypertext reference
>2.) Href contains information about the hyperlink.
>3.) Use headers corrrectly to organize content to help accessibility.


>Hyperlinks are simple ways to imbed a URL into HTML

```
<p>I'm creating a link to
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

>This above example links to the mozilla page

```
<p>I'm creating a link to
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
   title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

> The href in the above code will give you information about the > link and will display when you hover over it as a tooltip.

> The following code can turn an image into a link:

```
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <img src="mozilla-image.png" alt="mozilla logo that links to the Mozilla homepage">
</a>
```

## CSS


What is meant by “normal flow”?
> The way the page is displayed before changes are made to elements' layout
What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
> Block elements start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line.
___ positioning is the default for every html element.
Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
> very good cross browswer support



> The following are several blocks of code with imbedded text that explain CSS fairly well:

```
<h1>Basic document flow</h1>

<p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>

<p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>

<p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p>

<p>Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg"></p>
```

```
body {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

p {
  background: rgba(255,84,104,0.3);
  border: 2px solid rgb(255,84,104);
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

span {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

> Static Positioning is the default tht every element gets. 
To see this (and get your example set up for future sections) first add a class of positioned to the second <p> in the HTML:

```
<p class="positioned"> … </p>
```

> Now add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:

```
.positioned {
  position: static;
  background: yellow;
}
```

> If you save and refresh, you'll see no difference at all, except for the updated background color of the 2nd paragraph. This is fine — as we said before, static positioning is the default behavior!

> Relative Positioning allows you to change its position after its position in the normal flow. 

```
position: relative
```
## Learn JS

Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
> Declarations establish the function and invocations call on that function to perform its internals
What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
> Parameters are the variables defined when the function is declared. Arguments are the values we enter when calling that function.

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

It keeps you engaged...honestly paired programming is my favotire type of programming. It also keeps you accountable.

It improves the quality and streamlines debugging
