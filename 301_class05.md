 What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
 > A componenet should ideally on do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
> You build the UI but it has no interactivity

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
>Apparently, start thinking stop typing? you strt to build the interactivity into the app.

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

How can you identify where state needs to live?
>Determine everything that needs to render something based off that state, then find a common owner or componenet in the hierarchy.

What is a “higher-order function”?
>functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them.

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
>it is returning M as true or false based on if M is greater than N

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
>A map is a method that transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array.

## Thinking in React

### Step 1: Start with a mock:

So the mock seems to be where we determine what our components are going to be. There are also some guiding principles about single responsibility; that is each component should only be responsible for one thing.

But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

### Step 2: Build a static version in react:

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.

The important takeaways from this section are that your end state should be a library of reusable components and that the heirarchy of your components and your data-models are sound and adhere to the one-way binding principle. 

>Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.

>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

>You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

>At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call root.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast.

### Step 3: Identify the Minimal Representation of the UI state:

Changes to the underlying data model requires the use of state. 

The principle here is that some things do not need to be stored and that you the acronym DRY (do not repeat yourself). The example is If I want to recall the length of an array I dont need to store that. The array itself intrinsically stores it's own length.

To determine whether or not something is state you should ask three things about it:

>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

After determination about what in your app is state you need to determine who owns, or mutates, this state. The important part here is React uis a flow down component hierarchy. Its likely not immediately clear which component should own what state. To help you figure this out follow the following steps:

>Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
>Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
>Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
>If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

Step 5: Add inverse Data Flow:

Callbacks will call setState or some sort of state function.
