# My time

> This is an interesting premise but I feel like the author missed the mark. I have always operated under the idea that time is the only actual currency you have. You trade it for money and trade that money back to sustain yourself and make your time more comfortable. I have already used this to justify a slew of personal services from yardcare to cleaning to laundry. I can get more out of that time being at work and additionally provide means for other people in the local economy.

> On the other hand the idea seems to focus on making money: "broke unhappy and stuck" which is a very stupid notion. I already make over 200k a year and can tell you definitively that there is no price to overcome the oportunity cost of leisure, family, relaxing, playing with the dogs, and doing stupid, pointless shit. I also recommend hobbies that take an not inconsiderable amount of time and have nothing to do with your workspace. 

> The idea of focus makes a bit of sense - in that you should remove those things that dont actually add to your value when youre not engaging in anything else. 

# Thinking like a programmer

> have a plan. Psuedo code your way through it. I need x output...to get that i need x input into x..etc

> Big problems should be deconstructed and worked on one by one

> debug : rubber duck coding

> Practice....practice

# five why's

> this seems like one of those tools taught to PMs who need to be taught basics like "you should find out what your customer wants"...
