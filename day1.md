So the most important thing I learned so far in markdown is "quoting code" ...this is super important because...__DOUBLE CLICKING IT ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT ALL THE CODE__...also there is a copy button to the right... ...essential for copy-pasta.

This is done by using the the 'strike' which is the primary to the tilde~~ to the left of the one on your keyboard: ```

```
When used it looks like this!
```
Which is pretty cool.
Something similar is blocktext:
> which
> looks like
> this

 We can also do things like;
~~strikethrough~~ using double tildes at the lead and follow of a statement, **bold** using double lead and follow asterix, and __italic__ using underscores!
