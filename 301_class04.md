What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
>Alright, so , in react state is only updated on setState(), I believe this is also when it is rendered. HTML elements maintain their own state and update based on user input =====> When react state becomes the "single source of truth." Then the component rendered in React, as a form, also controls what happens in that form on subsequest user input. When the input form is controlled by React it is called a "controlled component."

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

I honestly didn't see an answer to this question in the reading or video.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
>It looks like we bind the input into the state and then use super and props to pass it from the component into the render component.

Why would we use a ternary operator?
>Ternaries are used to make comparison. There are cases when if/else cannot be used and the ternary can.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
const thingy = (x === y) ? 'true' : 'false';
return thingy
``` 

## Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

So a juxtoposition of the two looks like so:

```
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

```
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  >  this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

 > handleSubmit(event) {
 >   alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
 >   event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
 >     <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
 >         <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

>the important take away from the above is that were setting this.state to the value, define our handlers.

>handleChange(event) sets the state to the event target value

This is then used as the value in the render

I am uncertain here what the preventDefault is preventing other than the obvious

## Alternatives to Controlled Components

>It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.

## Fully-Fledged Solutions

>If you’re looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, Formik is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state — so don’t neglect to learn them.



# Ternary statements

## The basics

Ternaries are like if statements that allow a block of code to be executed if a condition is met.

Ternaries are mostly functional around their syntax:

> condition ? value if true : value if false

Condition being what youre testing
the ? seperates our conditional from our true value (which is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.)

The : is what is executed if it doesn't meet your condition. 

## Nested Ternary

This essentially allows several different things to be evaluated as if you were nesting a forloop. The example given is:

```
let isStudent = false;
let isSenior = true;
let price = isStudent ? 8 : isSenior ? 6 : 10
console.log(price);
// 6
```

## Things I would like to know more about

This all looks involved yo....
I am uncertain here what the preventDefault is preventing other than the obvious when it comes to forms.
