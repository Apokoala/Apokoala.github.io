# The Code Im Still Ashamed of.

Though I read a lot of these articles this one was the most impactful. It is interesting because from an abstract level the themes of this article are something I can relate to. There are a few things I disagree with here. The main one being while he was ashamed, what did he do to atone? Did he provide that information to the victim's parents? I have a lot of questions about what took place afterwards. I did agree with the conclusion that, when possible, it is our moral duty to ensure that the technology we build is being used ethically. 

# The ehtical dilemmas of self-driving cars

As far as I could extrapolate there were two major posits from this article: That we, as humans, will normalize being driven by computers given the chance; and that very relinquishment of control creates an obligation to deliberate on how we desire our machines to act in situations of ethical dilema. In the first posit; I agree with the author that we will, over time, grow accustomed to self-driving cars. As far as ethics go the author mentions Germany's rules. These guidelines state that autonomous vehicles should minimize human death without taking into account any of the properties of those humans (age, gender, etc). From an abstract position this seems very reasonable. However...what if the minimization of the cost to human life involves killing the autonomous vehicle's owner? Does the manufacturer not have obligations to protect the safety of its customer? Additionally, what about fault? What about intent? Could carjackers jump in front of cars driven by single people to cause a crash? It seems an issue too deep to be solved with a series of decision trees.
