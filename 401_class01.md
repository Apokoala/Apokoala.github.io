How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
>If the Javascript language is a car, Node is the highway and surface road systems. It is where Javascript runs. Its not the only place you can take the car. 

What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
>A runtime describes software or instructions that are executed while your program is running. Node will handle call stacks and memory allocations. It is important
>to understand that its running instructions that the dev did not write eexplicitly, but are necessary for and promote the running of the code.

>Calling it an environment is very important I think, as those are the natural laws of your development environment

What is Node used for?

>It allows people to run JS directly in the computer process instead of explicitly in a browser.
