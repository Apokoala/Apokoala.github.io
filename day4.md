# Day 4 HTML 

## Wireframe and Design

In order to make good HTML wireframes you have to conform to three principles:

>maintain clarity
>gain user confidence
>simplicity is key

Create research --> User flow

Wireframing within the user flow contains the structure of your entire site and should be focused on the user experience as well as the functionality you are trying to provide. While wireframing is important it's best to add some details to your wireframes and start testing.

## HTML Basics

What is HTML: A markup language that defines the structure of your content.

These consist of **elements** which act as containers for different parts of your content to make it look or act a certain way. 

Each element consists of an __opening tag__ and a __closing tag__ with the content between them. The entirety of which is the **element**

Attributes can be contained within the tag. These contain information about the element that you dont want to appear in the actual content.

You may nest elements.

Empty elements: these dont wrap content rather they embed so there is no need to include a closing tag

## Headings

><h1>My main title</h1>

headings run through 6 levels but you are only likely to use 3 or 4 at most.

## Comments

><!--> comment comment comment -->
This is an html comment. The browswer will ignore it as it is rendering the code.
