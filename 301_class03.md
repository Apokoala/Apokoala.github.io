 What does .map() return?
> It returns an array from an array input


If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
Each list item needs a unique ____.
>I am fairly certain it needs a unique element, represented by a location on the array for that element.


What is the purpose of a key?
>The purpose of a key is to identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 

What is the spread operator?
>It is a usefula dn quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function's arguments. 


List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
>Beyond just allowing you to use an array as an individual argument it can be used for math functions, using an array as an argument, addint an item to a list, and combining objects. 


Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.


Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
```
const num = ['1','2','3']
cont moreNum = [...num, '4','5']
console.log(moreNum) //returns '1','2','3','4','5'
```
or
```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
``` 


Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
> create the function wherever were going to change the state.

In your own words, what does the increment function do?
>the increment function sets a variable as a the state of the the mapping of the people array with the altered version of the count for the target and then changes the state of the people array. 

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
>using props

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
>By invoking it on the handler, in this instance on click calls this.increment which passes the name bob into the function which updates the parent's state.

## How to use the spread operator in JS:

The spread syntax is simply `...`. When using this you can expand an array into a list of arguments. 

A good example of this is the following:

```
Math.max(1,3,5) // 5
Math.max([1,3,5]) // NaN
```
it cant iterate an array because the array is considered to be a single argument. Using spread you can have it iterate through the array much in the same way it would in a for loop:

```
Math.max(...[1,3,5]) // 5
```

In additon to this the spread operator can be used for an *array* of things like:

+Copying an array
+Concatenating or combining arrays
+Using Math functions
+Using an array as arguments
+Adding an item to a list
+Adding to state in React
+Combining objects
+Converting NodeList to an array

### Copying an array:

```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```

### Concatenating arrays:

```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

### Using math functions:

```
const numbers = [37, -17, 7, 0]
console.log(Math.min(numbers)) // NaN
console.log(Math.min(...numbers)) // -17
console.log(Math.max(...numbers)) // 37
```

### Using an array as an object:

```
const fruitStand = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const sellFruit = (f1, f2, f3) => { console.log(`Fruits for sale: ${f1}, ${f2}, ${f3}`) }
sellFruit(...fruitStand) // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍊, 🍌
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.push('🍉')
fruitStand.push('🍍')
sellFruit(...fruitStand) // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍉, 🍍
fruitStand.pop()
fruitStand.pop()
sellFruit(...fruitStand,'🍋') // Fruits for sale: 🍏, 🍋, undefined
```

### Adding an item to list:

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

### Adding to State in React:

```
import React, { useState } from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

import "./styles.css"

function App() {
  // React Hooks declarations
  const [searches, setSearches] = useState([])
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("")

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Add the search term to the list onClick of Search button
    // (Actually searching would require an API call here)

    // Save search term state to React Hooks
    setSearches(searches => [...searches, query])
  }
  
  // ...
  ```

### Combining objects:

```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

### Converting Node List to Array:

```
[...document.querySelectorAll('div')]
```

### How to do it manually:

When programming to support Internet Explorer and browsers on older mobile devices, the spread operator is not going to work.

In that case, the function Function.prototype.apply() will have the same effect as the spread syntax:

```
// Using Function.prototype.apply() instead of the spread operator
[1,3,5].min() // undefined
Math.min([1,3,5]) // NaN
Math.min().apply(null, [1,3,5]) // 1
Math.max().apply(null, [1,3,5]) // 5
```
