## Growth Mindset

What I learned about the growth mindset is that it requires effort. It seems that the dichotomy of a "growth" mindset is a juxtaposition of what is natural: "a fixed mindset." For instance I find myself guilty of several of the tendencies of the fixed.

I know it's cheesy but I think I might get some sort of doo-dad that has "growth mindset" on it...maybe they have rubber ducks that have them embossed on them. Or maybe I'll include some of the aspects of it in a mantra or something similar. 

This is a place to take notes...i dont have much here because I just started and am a bit late to the coursework (3 days)...uh oh!

## Learning Markdown

So the most important thing I learned about markdown is "quoting code"

This is done by using the the 'strike' which is the primary to the tilde~~ to the left of the one on your keyboard: ```

```
When used it looks like this!
```
Which is pretty cool.
Something similar is blocktext:
> which
> looks like
> this

 We can also do things like;
~~strikethrough~~ using double tildes at the lead and follow of a statement, **bold** using double lead and follow asterix, and __italic__ using underscores!
