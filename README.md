## Growth Mindset

What I learned about the growth mindset is that it requires effort. It seems that the dichotomy of a "growth" mindset is a juxtaposition of what is natural: "a fixed mindset." For instance, I find myself guilty of several of the tendencies of the fixed mindset...actually, all of them.

I know it's cheesy but I think I might get some sort of doo-dad that has "growth mindset" on it...maybe they have rubber ducks that have them embossed on them. Or maybe I'll include some of the aspects of it in a mantra or something similar.

__edit__: I couldn't find one but i could find Captain Quack Sparrow

He is already in the cart.

## Learning Markdown

So the most important thing I learned so far in markdown is "quoting code" ...this is super important because...__DOUBLE CLICKING IT ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT ALL THE CODE__...also there is a copy button to the right... ...essential for copy-pasta.

This is done by using the the 'strike' which is the primary to the tilde~~ to the left of the one on your keyboard: ```

```
When used it looks like this!
```
Which is pretty cool.
Something similar is blocktext:
> which
> looks like
> this

 We can also do things like;
~~strikethrough~~ using double tildes at the lead and follow of a statement, **bold** using double lead and follow asterix, and __italic__ using underscores!

## Command Line

>Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne...again shell, or Bash
>you can find out which shell you are using by using the command:
>user@xxxx: echo $SHELL

### Where are you:
>user@bash: pwd
This stand for Print Working Directory and will tell you where you are.

### What is here:
>user@bash: ls
This stands for List and will list the contents of the directory you are in.
>ls//option//location is the structure for this command

### Absolute and relative paths:
You can give pathing relative to the root directory or relative to where you are within the subdirectories. 

### More on paths:
>~(Tilde) this is a shortcut for your home direcotory
>.(dot) this is your current directory
>.. (dot dot) this is your parent directory (the directory containing the one you're in)

### Moving around:
cd allows you to move around, dot dot for parent directory or you can list a subdirectory of the directory you are in. You can use tab to complete a sub-directory listing as long as what you've entered is unique.

### Moving around with quotes
Quotes allow you to move to a directory if you know its absolute name

>user@bash: cd 'farfignuten'
>user@bash: pwd
>/home/gaz/docs/whatisthisfor/farfignuten

A trick here to nullify spaces in order for them to not be a command is the BACK SLASH

>user@bash: cd farfignuten\ socks
>user@bash: pwd
>/home/gaz/docs/whatisthisfor/farfignuten socks
