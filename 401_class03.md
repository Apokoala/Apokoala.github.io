# Review ES6 Classes

Classes are a template for creating ____.
> creating objects

Can a class declaration be hoisted?
>no they cannot 

How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?

>A constructor creates objects. When you are working with methods in that object you can refer to the object using this.
An example:

``` 

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

const person = new Person('John');
person.greet();  // logs 'Hello, my name is John.'

```

# Using Express Routing

Within Express, what does routing refer to?
>Within express routing refers to the process of defining and handling URLs and HTTP methods for your application.
>Each route will consist of a URL pattern and a handler function that is called when the route is matched.

What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
> In the context of the Express web framework, a route path is the URL pattern that a route matches, and a route method is the HTTP method that the route handles.

When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
> It is appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler if you want to pass control to the next middleware function in the application.

# Express Routing 

What is an Express Router?
>An Express Router is a class that provides a way to define and organize routes for an Express application. It allows you to define routes and middleware in a modular and organized way, which can make it easier to maintain and extend your application.

By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?
> To initialize express.Router() in an Express server, you can create a new router object using the express.Router method, and then define routes and middleware on the router object. You can then use the app.use method to mount the router at a specific path in the main application.

```

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const usersRouter = express.Router();

usersRouter.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Listing users...');
});

usersRouter.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`Showing user with ID ${userId}...`);
});

app.use('/users', usersRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000.');
});

```

What do we use route middleware for?
> Route middleware is used in the Express web framework to perform tasks that are common to multiple routes or the entire application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, as well as the next function, which is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the application.
