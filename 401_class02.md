# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to Node.js and Express

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
>Middleware provides services and capabilities to software not provided by the OS.

Express the most popular __ __ ____.
> Node Web Framework

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
> It means there there are very little restrictions as to how things can be arranged and combined. There is "no right way to do something

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
>At its most fundamental level it is the encasement of an action. Those actions can be reused and called upon when needed. 

## What is NPM

What version of npm are you running on your machine?
> 8.19.2

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
> `npm i jshint`

## What is TDD

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
>Tests help us ensure that the action that were trying to achieve is the action that is being performed.

What are three expected benefits of testing
> Better Design
> Fewer Bugs
> Less Overhead from reduced time(fewer hours debugging)

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

>Individual:
>Writing too many tests.
>Not actually executing those tests as you continue development.

>Team:
>Unmaintained test suite.
>Non-utilization of tests by members of the team.

## CI/CD

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
>Easier: youre making smaller commits/changes which simplifies the tasks at hand
>faster: Because they are smaller and youre automating builds and tests code can get out faster, additionally feedback occurs faster so changes will happen incrementally rather than at the end.
>Less Risk: Because of incremenetal deployment the feedback loop with the stakeholders will ensure the product provided is the product requested. Additionally smaller changes and commits will make devs more confident about their code. 

What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
>Continuous delivery is the generation of code and modules. Deployment is the actual implementation of those changes.

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
>Github allows for automation of the deployment cycle, reducing downtime, transparently, with controls.
