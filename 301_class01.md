The main purpose of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. 

Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as −

>Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
>
>Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

>A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That

A component can have three different views:
Object-oriented View
Conventional View
Process relatd view

### Object-oriented view

>A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are >explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation. It also involves defining the interfaces that enable classes >to communicate and cooperate.

### Conventional view

>It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures that are required >to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.

### Process-related view

>In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is building from existing components maintained in a library. As the >software architecture is formulated, components are selected from the library and used to populate the architecture.

*A user interface (UI) component includes grids, buttons referred as controls, and utility components expose a specific subset of functions used in other components.

*Other common types of components are those that are resource intensive, not frequently accessed, and must be activated using the just-in-time (JIT) approach.

*Many components are invisible which are distributed in enterprise business applications and internet web applications such as Enterprise JavaBean (EJB), .NET components, and CORBA components.

###Characteristics of Components
* Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### Component-Level Design Guidelines
*Creates a naming conventions for components that are specified as part of the architectural model and then refines or elaborates as part of the component-level model.

**Attains architectural component names from the problem domain and ensures that they have meaning to all stakeholders who view the architectural model.

**Extracts the business process entities that can exist independently without any associated dependency on other entities.

**Recognizes and discover these independent entities as new components.

**Uses infrastructure component names that reflect their implementation-specific meaning.

**Models any dependencies from left to right and inheritance from top (base class) to bottom (derived classes).

**Model any component dependencies as interfaces rather than representing them as a direct component-to-component dependency.

###Conducting Component-Level Design
*Recognizes all design classes that correspond to the problem domain as defined in the analysis model and architectural model.

*Recognizes all design classes that correspond to the infrastructure domain.

*Describes all design classes that are not acquired as reusable components, and specifies message details.

*Identifies appropriate interfaces for each component and elaborates attributes and defines data types and data structures required to implement them.

*Describes processing flow within each operation in detail by means of pseudo code or UML activity diagrams.

*Describes persistent data sources (databases and files) and identifies the classes required to manage them.

*Develop and elaborates behavioral representations for a class or component. This can be done by elaborating the UML state diagrams created for the analysis model and by examining all use cases that are relevant to the design class.

*Elaborates deployment diagrams to provide additional implementation detail.

*Demonstrates the location of key packages or classes of components in a system by using class instances and designating specific hardware and operating system environment.

*The final decision can be made by using established design principles and guidelines. Experienced designers consider all (or most) of the alternative design solutions before settling on the final design model.

## What is "Props" and how to use it in React?

React is a component-based library that divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
