### Domain Modeling

Question 1
> Why do we need domain modeling?
A domain model that is well articulated can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.

### Defining a constructor

```
var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
}

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);

console.log(parkourFail);
console.log(corgiFail);
```

So what is happening above is the constructor is defined using an expression which creates EpicFailVideo then added the two prameters to it. When data is added inside these 

```
var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
}

EpicFailVideo.prototype.generateRandom = function(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);

console.log(parkourFail.generateRandom(1, 5));
console.log(corgiFail.generateRandom(1, 5));
```

What is very important about the above example of code is the "new" keyword. This allows you to create new objects within the constructor to store the values of the functions parameters.

There is a ton of good stuff in here so I am just going to post the link because Ill need to reference all of this for salmon cookies: [link](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

### HTML Tables

This is key [here](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

Explain why we need domain modeling.

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML 

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

## Day 6 Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### Object basics

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
> An object is either data that is relational or something with functionality.
What are some advantages to creating object literals?
> you can transfer a series of structured data 
How do objects differ from arrays?
> Objects contain informatiion about 
Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
>when you dont readily know the index number but know the name associated with the value youre trying to retrieve
Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
>it is referring to the object spot.
