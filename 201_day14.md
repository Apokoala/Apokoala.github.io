## CSS Transforms

>What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
>rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.

>Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
>Obviously it can be used in a design, perhaps skewing a picture to give it a 3d effect, if you integrate that percieved field of perception with something like a button with a hover effect it could be pretty cool. 


The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

>Syntax for transform:

```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

the prefixes allow it to be supported in many browsers with the last iteration taking place if the property is fully supported. 

### Rotation

```
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
```

```
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```

### Scale

```
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
``` 

```
.box-1 {
  transform: scale(.75);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scale(1.25);
}
```

```
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
<figure class="box-3">Box 3</figure>
```

```
.box-1 {
  transform: scaleX(.5);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scaleY(1.15);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: scale(.5, 1.15);
}
```


## Transitions & Animations 

>What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
>It provides a way to control animations when changing css properties i.e. if the properties are changing you can control the rate etc of what is happening

>How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
>transitions are simple and from-to movements. Animations are more complex.



### Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.

```
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  transition-property: background;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
}
```

Dont forget vendor prefixes

### Transition properties

transition property are essentially identifying the properties of the element that youre going to be "selecting" for change during the transition.

```
.box {
    background: #2db34a;
    border-radius: 6px
    transition-property: background, border-radius;
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
  }
  .box:hover {
    background: #ff7b29;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

```

Not all properties can be transitioned. Only those with identifiable half-way points.

### Transition Duration

how long the transition takes

```
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition-property: background, border-radius;
  transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
