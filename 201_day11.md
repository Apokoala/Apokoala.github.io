>How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Grid is made for two-dimensional layout while Flexbox is for one. This means Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both. 

>Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

a grid container is like a parent, the items are what are contained within that parent and the line is supporting the arrangement within the grid by numbering the tracks.




>Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?|
Helps optimization, improves loading time, and improves the user experience.


>Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
The `srcset` and `sizes` attributes on `img` (or `source`) elements allow authors to define various image resources and "hints" that assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate image source to display

>How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
it yeilds better results and uses less code.


### Video

embedding a video
```
<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

browsers are not created equally. some may not support your video mode. you may offload handing the video to a 3rd party site:

```
<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```


Other options for loading your video:

```
<video controls width="400" height="400"
       autoplay loop muted preload="auto"
       poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support this video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

### Grid

Honestly the website [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) is so good. I will likely use it as a reference rather than my notes.
