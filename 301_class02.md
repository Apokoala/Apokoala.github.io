Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
>It appears that the render happens first.

What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
>the very first thing that happens is the render phase, starting with mounting and the constructor.


Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
What does componentDidMount do?
> Constructor --> Render --> React Updates --> componentDidMount --> (react updates technically again) --> componentWillUnmount

What types of things can you pass in the props?
>You can pass values and it can be any type of davascript data from integers over objects to arrays.

What is the big difference between props and state?
>props is used to pass data from component to component and state is the data within the local component. 

When do we re-render our application?
>It renders when you call the setState function.

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
anything that is "hard" and isnt part of the information being worked on or arguments/data being passed in the same way as it is in a constructor. 

## Phases of component lifecycle

![Phases of the component lifecycle](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/0*0saPKFiTUk6W3FYp)

### Mounting 

>When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

Its important to understand that react is adding and manipulating the DOM via these components.

### Updating

>Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.

static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps

### Unmounting

>The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.

## Constructor

The constructor for a react componenet is called before it is mounted. If the component is a subclass you should call super(props), or the props will be undefined. Super is used to extent properties from the parent. Constructors can be used to assign state using this.state or to bind event handle methods to an instance.

## Render

Render is the only required method in a class component. It will examine this.props and this.state when called. The render functions hould not modify the component state because it would cause a lot of bugs vby cahngeing the state every time it rerenders. It also should not directly interact with the browsers. Render will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
