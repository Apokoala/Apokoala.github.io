Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

> Essentially this means that there is no 3rd dimension. I.E. there will not be "layers" where things rest on top of one another.

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

>The main axis is set by your flex-direction property and items will move as a group on the main axis. the cross axis will run in the opposite plane. 

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

>loadtimes and scaling

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

>child elements are easier with flexbox. FB is mobile friendly

How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

>Sure a lot better than arranging things with float

## Creating a flex container

```
<div class="container" id="container">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Item two</div>
  <div>The item we will refer to as three</div>
</div>
```

To use flexbox you need to declare that you want to use a flex formatting context and not regular block and inline layout. Do this by changing the value of the display property to flex.

```
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

wrapping a flex box

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

Flex flow. This iss a kind of short hand. I think this would be much more valuable than just the example they have here...they also dont go into the limitations all that much. 

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

flex allows things to grow and change and to change at different rates. 

You will need to control the distributed space between flex lines. The default value is going to be stretch. 

```
.container {
  align-content: center;
}
```

```
.container {
  place-content: space-between;
  /* sets both to space-between */
}

.container {
  place-content: center flex-end;
  /* wrapped lines on the cross axis are centered,
  on the main axis items are aligned to the end of the flex container */
}
```

Use any of the following values to align the item:

flex-start
flex-end
center
stretch
baseline
