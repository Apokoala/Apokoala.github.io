## HTML


```
const person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  bio: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
  introduceSelf: function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  }
};

```
Here you can see the object filled out. Lets explain it line by line:

line one defines the object
line 2 is a attribute, age with a value of 32.
next it declares a method (a method is a function within an object). Important here is 'this'. 'this' points to the object.
lastly notice the ";" following the curly brackets at the end. This is syntatically correct for objects.

### Dot notation.

Dot notation allows you access object properties:
For example:

```
const person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  bio() {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  }
};
```

this.name calls the property name. 

### Bracket Notation

```
person['age']
person['name']['first']
```
vs
```
person.age
person.name.first
```

This looks very similar to how you access an array...because it is...objects are sometimes called associative arrays.

### What is this?

The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside — so in this case this is equivalent to person. So why not just write person instead?

### Constructors

Dont want to copy and paste a ton of objects?! well...use a constructor.

```
function createPerson(name) {
  const obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.introduceSelf = function() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  }
  return obj;
}
```
This code will return an object using the parameters you put into the function.

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
An object in JS is a collection of related data. Key-pair values
What are some advantages to creating object literals?
They are easy to read and they are used by many plugins

How do objects differ from arrays?
objects can store data, arrays store values

Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
you would use it when the property is an invalid dot notation identifier

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

the code becomes reusable because it will perform the function on the method's parameters. 

What is the DOM?
the document object model 

Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

It represents the output as a node or object which js is used to manipulate.
