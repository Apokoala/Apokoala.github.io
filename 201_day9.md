>Why are forms so important in web development?
It is very important for being able to collect data from the users or user imputs. Web II, the ability for the web to interact with the user instead of just display information is based on this concept.

>When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
Order the form logically
only ask whats required
minimize typing effort
match fields to the size of the input
labels
forgiving formating

>List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

```
<form>	Defines an HTML form for user input
<input>	Defines an input control
<textarea>	Defines a multiline input control (text area)
<label>	Defines a label for an <input> element
<fieldset>	Groups related elements in a form
<legend>	Defines a caption for a <fieldset> element
<select>	Defines a drop-down list
<optgroup>	Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list
<option>	Defines an option in a drop-down list
<button>	Defines a clickable button
<datalist>	Specifies a list of pre-defined options for input controls
<output>	Defines the result of a calculation
```

## Event Listener

>How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
An event is some sort of stimulus that my code is designed to react to. You do x...so my code will recognize x and do y.

>When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
You will need to add the name of the event and the code that comprises the handler function

>Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
the target property returns the element that triggered the event. the target property gets the element on which the event originally occured, the object. 


>What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
Event capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM

## HTML for forms:

forms should follow this structure in HTML:

```
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
 <ul>
  <li>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
  </li>
  <li>
    <label for="mail">E-mail:</label>
    <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_email">
  </li>
  <li>
    <label for="msg">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
  </li>
 </ul>
</form>
```
