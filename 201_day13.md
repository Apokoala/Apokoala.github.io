## Local Storage

>Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

The main reason as far as i can tell is that the storage that is held in the local storage swill not expire



>What information should not be stored in local storage?

local storage should never be used for information such as personal information or passwords.


>Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

local storage can only store strings. Stringify should be used in order to convert data prior to storing.

Using local storage in modern browsers is easy. all you have to do is modify the localStorage object in js. You can do that directly or use the setItem and getItem method:

here are some code examples of how to accomplish thi:

```
localStorage.setItem('favoriteflavor','vanilla');
```

```
localStorage.removeItem('favoriteflavor');
var taste = localStorage.getItem('favoriteflavor');
// -> null
```


### Storing Objects and arrays

the best way to deal with these is a JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.

```
var car = {};
car.wheels = 4;
car.doors = 2;
car.sound = 'vroom';
car.name = 'Lightning McQueen';
console.log( car );
localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) );
console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );
```

##Storing the state of the interface

```
YUI().use('node', function(Y) {
  if(('localStorage' in window) && window['localStorage'] !== null){
    var key = 'lastyahoofirehose';

    localStorage.setItem(key,Y.one('form').get('innerHTML'));

  if(key in localStorage){
      Y.one('#mainform').set('innerHTML',localStorage.getItem(key));
      Y.one('#hd').append('

```
