## Functional Programming

What is functional programming?
> functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
>A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.

What are the benefits of a pure function?
>Pure functions also have some performance benefits. Because they don't modify the global state, they are faster than regular functions

What is immutability?
>unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

What is Referential transparency?
> referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.

What is a module?
>its a segregation of functional aspects of a program that makes the code easier to interact with and easier to maintain

What does the word ‘require’ do?
sets a dependency between two files


How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
>we import it. 

What do we have to do to make a module available?
>we have to export the module
